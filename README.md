# MGS627_Final_Project
The final project code for MGS627 of my group
We are making a dashboard to display League of Legends match history information in a graphical format
that is easier to read and digest than what is offered in the League of Legends Client.
There are several things that are required to use this dashboard.
1. You need to have a Riot Games API key
2. You need to know the Riot Name of the player 
3. You need to know the tagline of the player
4. You need to know the region of the player
You also need several packages for the code to run.
1. Requests
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Plotly
5. Dash
Once you have all of these things known and installed you are able to use the dashboard to visualize 
Damage Taken, Damage Dealt, and Damage Dealt to Champions for the last 20 games of the specified player!
